# 🗣️ AnonTalk - Anonymous Real-time Chat App

AnonTalk is a simple and clean real-time **anonymous chat application** built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **Socket.IO**. It allows users to chat without logging in — each user is assigned a random name. Users can send messages, view how many people are online, see who is typing, switch themes, and even use emojis!
